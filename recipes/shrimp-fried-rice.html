                <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced, or more to taste</li>
                <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li> 
                <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
                <li> <span>&#189;</span> teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
                <li> <span>&#189;</span> teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    
            </ul>
            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through.</p></li>
                <li><p>Remove shrimp from the skillet using a slotted spoon, allowing oils and cooking juices to remain in the skillet. Place shrimp on a plate and set aside.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add peas and carrots and corn to the skillet and cook, stirring intermittently, until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Push vegetables to the side of the skillet, pour eggs into the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary, 3 to 4 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Stir shrimp, rice, and green onions into the skillet. Drizzle evenly with soy sauce, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook until shrimp is reheated through, about 2 minutes.</p></li>
            </ol>
                <h5>Cook's Note:</h5>
                <p>Cooking time will vary based on size of shrimp. Be careful not to overcook.</p>
